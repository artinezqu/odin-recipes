    <h3>Steps</h3>

        <li>Cook onions, ½ of the garlic and pancetta in olive oil in a large heavy pot or Dutch oven until onions are translucent and pancetta is lightly browned</li>
        <li>Season with kosher salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Raise heat and add the wine, cook until nearly evaporated</li>
        <li>Add tomatoes and juice; simmer 30 minutes</li>
        <li>While the sauce simmers, in a large bowl mix together with your hands: ground beef, ¼ cup of the pecorino Romano cheese, ¼ cup of the chopped parsley, remaining minced garlic, 2 of the eggs and salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Brown Italian sausage and red pepper flakes in olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Transfer to sauce with a slotted spoon and discard most of the oil. Cook ground beef mixture, breaking up as you go, until lightly browned, but not quite cooked through; transfer to sauce and stir; simmer 45 minutes</li>
        <li>Combine cottage cheese, remaining 2 eggs, remaining pecorino Romano cheese and parsley, and ½ of the mozzarella, and salt and pepper in a large bowl</li>
        <li>Spoon a thick layer of meat sauce into a 9-by-12-inch baking dish and spread evenly. Cover with one layer of noodles. Spoon ¼ of the remaining sauce evenly over noodles followed by ⅓ of the cottage cheese mixture. Repeat for 2 more layers. Top with a final layer of noodles, and cover with the remaining sauce. Bake in a 350˚F oven 45 minutes</li>
        <li>Sprinkle remaining mozzarella evenly over the top. Bake 15 minutes more until cheese has melted. Let stand 15 minutes or more before serving</li>
