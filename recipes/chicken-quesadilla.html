    <h3>About the dish</h3>
    <p>A quesadilla is a Mexican dish that consists of a tortilla filled with cheese (and often other ingredients, such as meat and veggies). It’s cooked on a griddle or stove. Full quesadillas feature cheese sandwiched between two flat tortillas. Half quesadillas, like the one in this recipe, is a single tortilla that has been topped with fillings and folded into a half moon shape. </p>
    <p>This chicken quesadilla recipe is great to make for parties. Zesty chicken, cooked peppers, and melted cheese are a delightful combination. Cut into wedges and serve with sour cream and salsa.</p>
